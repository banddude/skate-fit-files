## How the App Works

SkateFit operates as a completely offline-first app that:

1. **Downloads Public Content**: The app downloads workout videos and instructions from our public GitHub repository (github.com/banddude/skate-fit-files)
2. **Stores Content Locally**: All workout content is cached on your device for offline use
3. **No Account Required**: You can use all app features without creating an account or providing any information
4. **No Data Transmission**: The app does not send any information about you or your usage back to us or any third parties

## Third-Party Services

### GitHub Content Delivery
- **What**: The app downloads workout content from GitHub's public content delivery network
- **Data Shared**: None - this is a standard web request that doesn't include personal information

### Apple App Store
- **What**: App downloads and updates are handled by Apple's App Store
